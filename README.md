# addStream

Exactly — you got it!

When you join, your code loops over all existing peers (connections[id2]). For each peer:

If you already have a connection to them → just attach your window.localStream (addStream).

No need to negotiate again.

If you don’t have a connection yet → you start the WebRTC handshake by sending an offer (createOffer → setLocalDescription → emit to peer).

That peer will reply with an answer, and only then the connection becomes usable.

So the try/catch block is just a shortcut way of saying:

👉 “If I’m connected, stream now. If I’m not, let’s connect first.”

Do you want me to draw you a step-by-step handshake flow diagram for this exact case?


# socket.io

The Socket.IO engine receives the message.
It checks its internal listener map to see if any callback is registered for "chat-message".
If yes → it calls the function with the data.
If no → nothing happens.

# What happens when you open the page:

Socket connection is established:

socketRef.current = io.connect(server_url);


The client connects to the server.

The server now knows there’s a new connected client.

Listeners are registered:

socketRef.current.on("chat-message", addMessage);
socketRef.current.on("user-joined", handleUserJoined);


Socket.IO stores these listeners internally for this specific socket connection.

Each client maintains its own set of listeners.

Server emits events:

When the server emits an event like "chat-message" or "user-joined", it sends it only to connected clients.

Each client checks its internal listener map. If a listener exists for that event, the callback is automatically triggered.
